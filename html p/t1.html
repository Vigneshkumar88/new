            <h3>Character</h3>
            <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">My character has both opened and closed many doors for me in life.
                Most of the time you will see that I'm very laid back and relaxed. Independence is one of my key
                qualities. I never like to bother people with my problems because ultimately they're not always going to
                be there for you. I roam around in silence; being loud and obnoxious is not something that has ever
                given me much success in life. I try to conquer a healthy and happy lifestyle, but you know how that
                usually goes. I am pretty athletic I believe because I have put in so much hard work and dedicated even
                more time to football throughout my eighteen years of life. My life experiences have given me a
                rebellious trait. For example, whenever I get yelled at in football by Coach …show more content…

                I didn't have a great childhood, mainly growing up around drugs, gangs, and gunshots every night, but
                when I got older my friends were the ones who saved me from all that madness by taking me into their
                arms and drifting me away from the wrong crowds. Now, I go back and see them and they're those people I
                thought they would never be. Drugs run far in the public schools of Massachusetts now that I realize it

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">I find embroidery making very interesting. It is my hobby. I spend
                some time on it every day. It is very refreshing and relaxing for me to engage in my hobby.

                I play with designs and colours. I can use different types of cloth to make embroidery on. I can choose
                many different colours of thread to make embroidery with. The patters I choose are also varied. I have
                made embroidered apparel and have always been excited to make a new item. Embroidery making is however
                time-consuming.

                I have made many interesting items of embroidery. I have made a chocolate cake embroidery on a table
                cloth. It looks like a real birthday cake. I also embroidered sparrows on a stole. I love the sparrow
                but do not see it now-a-days on my verandah. My friends like my stole because they too miss the sparrow.

                I am very fond of making embroidery on my mother’s sarees. My mother buys sarees on which I embroider
                small flowers, leaves and butterflies. My mother loves to drape these sarees. Embroidery can make
                designs alive in a very beautiful and colourful way. A plain apparel can become a fashion garment if it
                is embroidered tastefully.</p>
